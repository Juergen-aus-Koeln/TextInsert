This is a macro substitution plugin which enables substitutions of both words and longer
strings of text.

It provides an administrative panel which makes for simple adding, editing and deletion
of macros.

Much of the functionality of this plugin can be more easily implemented with Dokuwiki's
own entities facility: http://www.dokuwiki.org/entities.  The advantage of TextInsert
comes when dealing with extended blocks of text and with its ability to include other
macros inside the primary macro definition. That is, it can accept:

MACRO_1  This macro can include #@MACR0_2@# inside it.
MACRO_2  a second macro

The result is:
    This macro can include a second macro inside it.
    
It accepts only one level of macro inclusion, so that if MACRO_3 were included in
MACRO_2, MACRO_3 would not be rendered.

The macro definitions will also accept entities defined dokuwiki's conf/entities.conf and
user-defined entities conf/entities.local.conf.  Entities will be replaced in both the
primary and the included macros.

See http://dokuwiki.org/plugin:textinsert for further information.
